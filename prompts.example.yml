      # Your Goal
      The reader is currently reading a book series and has provided you with a question about the context of the book.
      You need to identify the IDs of text chunks that are likely to be relevant to a reader's question.

      # Your Output
      Provide a list of the IDs of the chunks that are most likely to contain relevant information.
      Provide a secondary query to send to a vector store that would retrieve more relevant chunks.
