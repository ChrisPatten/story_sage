This decision is painful for him because it signifies a shift in his quest; he must prioritize the lives of others over the mission to assist Frodo directly. He acknowledges that he would have guided Frodo to Mordor and gone with him to the end, but now he realizes that the Company cannot forsake their companions while they have strength left.</p>\n",

It is I that have failed. Vain was Gandalf’s trust in me\" [Book 2, Chapter 1]. This shows how deeply he feels the weight of leadership and the burden of loss, particularly with Boromir's death and the separation from Frodo.</p>\n",
