       "<div style=\"max-width:1000px;\"><p>The philosophy of the Tinkers, known as the Way of the Leaf, emphasizes peace and non-violence. The Tinkers believe that there is never any excuse for violence against another human being. This philosophy is deeply ingrained in their way of life, as illustrated by Raen's words: \"A violent life is stained even if long\" [Book 4, Chapter 41]. They strive to avoid conflict and seek safety in their nomadic lifestyle, always moving to escape the potential for violence that can arise when people gather in one place. Raen expresses a sense of urgency in finding the 'song,' a metaphor for peace and safety, as he notes, \"Surely we must find the song soon. Else I do not believe it will ever be\" [Book 4, Chapter 41]. </p>\n",
       "<p>The Tinkers also face challenges in adhering to their beliefs, especially in a world filled with threats like Trollocs and the Dark One. Perrin reflects on their commitment to the Way of the Leaf, acknowledging their peaceful stance even in the face of danger: \"They would not raise a hand against anyone, even to defend their own lives\" [Book 4, Chapter 41]. This unwavering dedication to peace defines the Tinkers and their interactions with the world around them.</p>\n",

They are known for their colorful wagons and a lifestyle that values music, dance, and community. The Tinkers avoid conflict and violence, preferring to travel and live freely, which sets them apart from other groups in the world. In their interactions, they often express a strong aversion to violence, as seen when Raen, the leader of the Tuatha'an, welcomes Perrin and his companions but explains their preference to stay away from villages to avoid conflict. This reflects their broader philosophy of non-violence and a desire to live harmoniously with others, despite the dangers they face from external threats like Trollocs and Whitecloaks. </p>\n",
