    "## RAPTOR\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook uses the RAPTOR (Recursive Abstractive Processing for Tree-Organized Retrieval) model to managed information. At a high level, RAPTOR is a pattern of recursively grouping chunks of text and generating a summary for each group, then grouping those summaries to create a tree of the text. This tree can be used to navigate the text and retrieve relevant information.\n",
    "\n",
    "RAPTOR differs from traditional RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) in a few key ways:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Data Organization**\n",
    "  - RAG: Stores and retrieves information as flat chunks in a vector database. Each chunk is treated independently, which can limit the model’s ability to understand broader context.\n",
    "  - RAPTOR: Organizes data hierarchically in a tree structure. It recursively clusters and summarizes chunks at each level, capturing broader context and enabling multi-level abstraction.\n",
    "2. **Context Representation**\n",
    "  - RAG: Focuses on retrieving relevant chunks directly from the vector store. This can result in limited understanding of large-scale discourse since it only uses short, isolated text chunks.\n",
    "  - RAPTOR: Summarizes clusters of chunks at each tree layer, creating a more comprehensive representation of the information. This approach allows RAPTOR to synthesize knowledge across multiple sections of a document.\n",
    "3. **Efficiency and Scalability**\n",
    "  - RAG: Retrieval is straightforward but can struggle with large datasets or complex queries due to its flat structure.\n",
    "  - RAPTOR: The hierarchical tree structure enables more efficient retrieval by narrowing down relevant information through recursive summarization, making it better suited for large and complex datasets.\n",
    "4. **Handling Complex Queries**\n",
    "  - RAG: Relies on retrieving specific chunks that match the query, which may lead to less accurate responses for nuanced or multi-faceted questions.\n",
    "  - RAPTOR: Uses the tree structure to consider information at various levels of detail, improving context awareness and response accuracy for complex queries.\n",
    "5. **Error Reduction**\n",
    "  - RAG: While it reduces hallucinations compared to standalone generative models, it may still retrieve irrelevant or incomplete chunks due to its flat organization.\n",
    "  - RAPTOR: Addresses these issues by summarizing and clustering information, reducing the likelihood of irrelevant or fragmented retrievals.\n",
    "\n",
    "For more on RAPTOR, see the [official paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.18059) and the [official GitHub repository](https://github.com/parthsarthi03/raptor/tree/master). Much of the code in this next section was adapted from a great article by Vipul Maheshwari on [VectorHub](https://superlinked.com/vectorhub/articles/improve-rag-with-raptor)."

    "## Concepts\n",
    "\n",
    "### Embeddings\n",
    "An embedding is a numerical vector representation of a piece of text.\n",
    "These vectors capture the semantic meaning of the text, allowing us to\n",
    "measure similarity by comparing vector distances.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM)\n",
    "A Gaussian Mixture Model is like using multiple bell curves to describe these groups. Think of it like sorting different types of fruits into baskets, but instead of definite placement, each fruit gets a percentage chance of belonging to each basket.\n",
    "It’s smarter than just putting things in strict categories - it allows for some flexibility and uncertainty in how things are clustered.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Dimensionality Reduction\n",
    "When we have a lot of data, it can be hard to visualize or work with. Dimensionality reduction is a way to simplify this data by reducing the number of features (dimensions) while keeping the most important information. This makes it easier to understand and work with the data, while still capturing the essence of the original information.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Similarity Search\n",
    "Similarity search is a way to find items that are similar to a given item. This is useful for recommendation systems, search engines, and many other applications. By using embeddings to represent items as vectors, we can measure the similarity between them and find the most relevant items. This allows us to group similar items together and make recommendations based on these similarities."

      "Answer: Dumbledore's decision to have Harry grow up with the Dursleys rather than with a wizarding family is rooted in the belief that it is best for Harry to be distanced from the wizarding world until he is ready to embrace it. Dumbledore emphasizes that Harry would be safer and better off away from the fame and attention he would attract as \"the boy who lived.\" This choice seems to be made with a protective instinct, ensuring that Harry has a chance at a normal childhood, albeit with a rather unsuitable family.\n",
      "\n",
      "Harry’s experience with the Dursleys plays a significant role in shaping his character. Living with the Dursleys, who are proud of their normality and disdainful of anything unusual, means that Harry grows up feeling isolated and undervalued. Their neglect and mistreatment foster resilience and a deep sense of empathy within Harry. The stark contrast between his life with the Dursleys and what he later discovers about the wizarding world amplifies his appreciation for friendship, loyalty, and the importance of family.\n",

      "Answer: Harry's wand takes a while to choose him because the process of selecting the right wand is unique and personal to each wizard. Mr. Ollivander, the wandmaker, explains that \"the wand chooses the wizard,\" which means that the connection between a wand and its owner is essential for effective magic. Each wand is made from different materials and has a magical core that influences its characteristics and how it interacts with its wizard. \n",

      "\n",
      "Answer: In the beginning, Harry and Ron's relationship with Hermione is marked by some tension, particularly due to Hermione's academic prowess and her tendency to follow rules. Ron, for instance, feels overshadowed when Hermione excels in their Charms class, which leads to a moment of frustration between them. This tension is further compounded by Hermione's initial insistence on being cautious, which Ron and Harry sometimes find annoying.\n",

      "However, their friendship begins to grow significantly after they face danger together, such as when they confront the mountain troll. This shared experience of defeating the troll serves as a bonding moment, illustrating the idea that some experiences can forge strong connections.

Hermione's cleverness and resourcefulness are invaluable in critical situations, like when she deduces the correct potions to drink to pass through the obstacles guarding the Sorcerer's Stone. Ron's bravery is highlighted during the chess game, where he sacrifices himself for the sake of Harry and Hermione, showcasing his willingness to put himself in harm's way for his friends.

      "Question: Why does Dumbledore give Harry the Cloak of Invisibility? Why is the Cloak so important to Harry?\n",
      "\n",
      "Answer: Dumbledore gives Harry the Invisibility Cloak because it is a significant heirloom that once belonged to Harry's father. This gesture not only connects Harry to his family but also symbolizes the protection and legacy of love that his parents left behind. The Cloak is important to Harry for several reasons: it offers him a sense of freedom and excitement as he explores Hogwarts at night, allowing him to experience the school in a way that he couldn't otherwise. Additionally, it serves as a tangible reminder of his father, enhancing Harry's emotional connection to his family, especially during a time when he is learning more about his past and the sacrifices his parents made.\n",

      "The Cloak also plays a critical role in Harry's adventures, as it helps him evade danger, such as when he sneaks into the Restricted Section of the library.

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Answer: The Mirror of Erised plays a significant role in \"Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone,\" symbolizing the deepest desires of people's hearts. Dumbledore's explanation emphasizes that while the mirror reveals what individuals yearn for most, it does not provide knowledge or truth. When he says, “this mirror will give us neither knowledge nor truth,” he means that simply seeing our desires does not help us understand ourselves or our reality. It can lead to obsession, as people may become entranced by what they see, losing touch with the real world in the process.\n",

From what you've shared, Snape's cold and disdainful demeanor in Potions class creates a hostile environment for Harry. Snape's blatant favoritism towards Draco Malfoy only exacerbates the situation, making Harry feel targeted and humiliated. Additionally, Harry experiences a physical reaction to Snape, feeling a sharp pain in his scar when he looks at him, which adds an element of fear and suspicion to their relationship.\n",
      "\n",
      "Moreover, Harry's growing belief that Snape is somehow involved in nefarious activities related to the Sorcerer's Stone contributes to his negative feelings. Harry suspects Snape knows more than he's letting on, creating an atmosphere of mistrust. This animosity is mutual; Snape seems to harbor a deep-seated disdain for Harry, possibly linked to his past with Harry's father, which adds another layer to their conflict.\n",

      "Question: Why does Dumbledore decide to have Harry grow up with the Dursleys rather than with one of the wizard families? How does Harry’s experience with his relatives build his character?\n",
      "\n",
      "Answer: Dumbledore decides to leave Harry with the Dursleys because he believes it is best for Harry to grow up away from the wizarding world until he is ready to understand it. This decision is made despite Professor McGonagall's concerns about the Dursleys' suitability as guardians, as she worries that Harry will become famous and face unnecessary attention. Dumbledore reassures her that it is important for Harry to have a chance at a normal upbringing, away from the fame that comes with being \"the boy who lived.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Harry's experience with the Dursleys significantly shapes his character. Growing up in a household that treats him poorly—subjecting him to neglect and bullying from his cousin Dudley—builds resilience in Harry. His difficult upbringing fosters a sense of empathy and understanding towards others who are marginalized or mistreated. This foundation of hardship contributes to his growth into a compassionate and brave individual as he navigates the challenges of the wizarding world.\n",

      "\n",
      "Answer: Harry's experience with Mr. Ollivander in the wand shop illustrates a significant aspect of the wizarding world—the idea that \"the wand chooses the wizard.\" This notion suggests that a wand has its own unique characteristics and preferences that resonate with certain individuals. In Harry's case, he tries several wands before finding the right one: a holly wand with a phoenix feather, which produces sparks upon being waved. \n",
      "\n",
      "The reason it takes some time for Harry's wand to choose him is that he is a \"tricky customer,\" as Mr. Ollivander notes. The process involves trying different wands until one responds to Harry's magical potential. When he finally finds the wand that fits, it feels warm in his hand, indicating a connection.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Ollivander's statement that \"the wand chooses the wizard\" emphasizes the bond between a wizard and their wand, suggesting that each wand is unique and will work best with its rightful owner. Additionally, Ollivander mentions that Harry's wand has a connection to the wand that gave him his lightning scar, hinting at a deeper significance in Harry's magical journey. \n",

      "Question: When Harry first meets Malfoy, he reminds him of Dudley. How are these two alike? How are they different?\n",
      "\n",
      "Answer: Dudley Dursley and Draco Malfoy share some similarities, particularly in their behaviors and attitudes. Both characters exhibit a sense of entitlement and a tendency to bully others. Dudley, as portrayed in the early chapters, is spoiled by his parents and often throws tantrums to get what he wants, such as when he complains about his birthday presents. He is physically imposing and uses his size to intimidate Harry and others, much like Malfoy does at Hogwarts, where he often belittles those he considers inferior, including Harry, Ron, and Neville.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, they also have notable differences. Dudley is primarily a product of his upbringing in a neglectful and indulgent household, which shapes his arrogant demeanor and bullying nature. He lacks any magical abilities or finesse, relying on his physicality and the backing of his parents to assert dominance. In contrast, Draco Malfoy is a wizard from a wealthy family with a strong belief in blood purity, which informs his disdain for Muggle-borns like Harry and Hermione. Malfoy possesses magical skills and a sense of superiority that is rooted in his family's status in the wizarding world, making him a more complex character in terms of his motivations and the societal structures he embodies.\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, while both exhibit bullying behavior and a sense of entitlement, Dudley's motivations stem from his upbringing as a spoiled child, whereas Malfoy's are intertwined with the prejudices of the wizarding world and his family's legacy.\n",

      "\n",
      "Answer: In the beginning, Harry and Ron's initial feelings toward Hermione are mixed. While they don't outright dislike her, there are moments of tension, particularly highlighted during their Charms class where Hermione excels while Ron struggles. This leads to some awkwardness, especially when Hermione feels isolated after a mishap with the mountain troll. However, their relationship begins to grow when they come together to confront the troll, which ultimately solidifies their friendship. The shared experience of defeating the troll creates a bond between them, demonstrating that sometimes, shared challenges can forge strong connections.\n",
      "\n",
      "As their friendship develops, each character brings unique qualities to their adventures. Hermione's strengths lie in her intelligence, resourcefulness, and extensive knowledge of spells and potions, which often helps the trio navigate tricky situations. Ron contributes loyalty, bravery, and a strategic mindset, as seen in his self-sacrifice during the giant chess game. Harry, with his courage and natural talent, often takes the lead in their adventures and faces challenges head-on, showcasing his determination.\n",

      "Answer: Dumbledore gives Harry the Invisibility Cloak as a gift during the Christmas holidays, and it holds significant importance for Harry for several reasons. The cloak, which Harry suspects once belonged to his father, symbolizes a connection to his family and his past, something Harry has longed for since he lost them. When Harry uses the cloak, he experiences a sense of freedom and excitement, feeling that the whole of Hogwarts is open to him.\n",

      "The cloak enables Harry to explore the castle without being seen, allowing him to navigate the challenges of Hogwarts in a way that feels empowering.

      "\n",
      "As Harry grapples with his emotions surrounding his family and the loss he feels, the cloak becomes a tangible link to his past, representing both his parents and the love they had for him, which is a recurring theme throughout his journey.

      "Answer: The Mirror of Erised serves a significant role in \"Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone.\" It reflects the deepest and most desperate desires of a person's heart, as Dumbledore explains to Harry. This means that while the mirror can show one what they long for most intensely, it does not provide truth or knowledge about how to achieve those desires. Dumbledore's warning suggests that becoming too fixated on one's dreams can lead to madness or a failure to live in reality. \n",

First and foremost, Harry feels targeted and humiliated during Potions class, where Snape shows blatant favoritism towards Draco Malfoy and treats Harry with disdain. This negative treatment creates a strong animosity in Harry towards Snape.\n",

Dumbledore later notes that Snape and Harry's father loathed each other when they were at Hogwarts, suggesting that Snape's feelings towards Harry may be colored by his past with James.\n",
      "\n",
      "Harry's discomfort around Snape is compounded by the mysterious connection he feels, particularly when he experiences pain in his scar upon seeing Snape, hinting at a deeper bond tied to Voldemort. This creates a sense of fear and suspicion in Harry, leading him to believe that Snape might be involved in darker activities.\n",
