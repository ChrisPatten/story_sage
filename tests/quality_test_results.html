<li>Dumbledore explains that Harry has the ability to speak with snakes because a fragment of Voldemort's soul is attached to him, which grants him this power: "It is that which gives him the power of speech with snakes, and a connection with Lord Voldemortâ€™s mind that he has never understood." (Book 7, Chapter 33)</li>
<li>The ability to speak Parseltongue is a unique trait associated with Voldemort and Harry, as Harry's connection to Voldemort allows him to communicate with snakes.</li>
