  (Book 1, Chapter 3)</li>
</ul></td><td><p>I don't have enough information to answer the question about Harry's aunt and uncle's address.</p></td></tr><tr><td>What is the name for a person who can talk to snakes?</td><td><ul>
<li>The name for a person who can talk to snakes is "Parseltongue." </li>
<li>In Book 1, Chapter 2, Harry appears to communicate with the boa constrictor at the zoo: “Harry was talking to it, weren’t you, Harry?” (Book 1, Chapter 2). </li>
<li>This ability is hinted at when the snake seems to respond to Harry and even says, “Brazil, here I come. … Thanksss, amigo” (Book 1, Chapter 2). </li>
</ul>
<p>These excerpts suggest that Harry has a unique connection with snakes, indicating that he may possess the ability of Parseltongue.</p></td><td><ul>
<li>The term for a person who can talk to snakes is "Parseltongue." This ability is described as unusual and is associated with dark magic.</li>
<li>
<p>"Parseltongue, the ability to converse with snakes, has long been considered a Dark Art." (Book 4, Chapter 31)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Harry Potter is one of the characters known to possess this ability.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>"You can talk to snakes!” “I know,” said Harry." (Book 2, Chapter 11)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The ability to speak Parseltongue is linked to Salazar Slytherin, the founder of Slytherin House.</p>
</li>
<li>“Being able to talk to snakes was what Salazar Slytherin was famous for." (Book 2, Chapter 11)</li>
</ul></td></tr><tr><td>How does Hermione's attitude toward house rules change from when we first meet her to now?</td><td><p>Hermione's attitude toward house rules has evolved significantly from her initial introduction to her current behavior. Here are some excerpts that illustrate this change:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Initial Concern for House Points</strong>: When we first meet Hermione in Chapter 9, she is very focused on the rules and the importance of house points. She confronts Ron and Harry, expressing her frustration that they don't care about Gryffindor winning the House Cup: </li>
<li>
<p>"Don’t you care about Gryffindor, do you only care about yourselves, I don’t want Slytherin to win the House Cup..." (Book 1, Chapter 9).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Desire for Structure</strong>: In Chapter 14, Hermione is depicted as someone who is highly organized and dedicated to her studies, creating study schedules and insisting that Ron and Harry do the same, showcasing her adherence to a structured approach:</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>"She had started drawing up study schedules and color-coding all her notes." (Book 1, Chapter 14).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Becoming More Social</strong>: By Chapter 10, although Hermione initially stands alone, she quickly becomes part of the group after a shared experience, indicating that her strict adherence to rules is beginning to give way to valuing friendship:</p>
</li>
<li>"But from that moment on, Hermione Granger became their friend." (Book 1, Chapter 10).</li>
</ul>
<p>Overall, Hermione's initial rigid adherence to house rules and expectations has softened as she establishes friendships and learns to balance her dedication to academics with social interactions.</p></td><td><ul>
<li>
<p>In Book 4, Chapter 9, Hermione is passionate about the rights of house-elves and is upset with Ron's dismissive attitude towards their treatment. She argues against the idea that house-elves are happy being bossed around, indicating her strong stance on injustice: “It’s disgusting the way —” (Book 4, Chapter 9).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>By Book 5, Chapter 29, Hermione's assertiveness in discussions continues, as she takes charge of the conversation and demands Ron's opinion, signaling her desire to be involved in decisions and her confidence in challenging her friends: “What do you think about this?” Hermione demanded of Ron (Book 5, Chapter 29).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In Book 6, Chapter 5, Hermione's frustration with Ron's lack of seriousness about their situation is evident. She distances herself from him when he doesn't seem to grasp the gravity of having someone unexpected around, showing her growing impatience with complacency: “It’s pathetic,” said Hermione furiously (Book 6, Chapter 5).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Overall, Hermione's attitude has evolved from one of passionate advocacy for house-elf rights to a more general impatience with those who do not take their responsibilities seriously. She is more willing to confront her friends about their attitudes, suggesting a maturation in her character where she expects more from those around her. </p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Overall, Hermione's stance on house rules and injustices has shifted from a focused and passionate advocacy to a broader impatience with injustice and complacency among her peers.</p></td></tr><tr><td>What events led to Harry joining the Quidditch team?</td><td><p>Harry joined the Quidditch team as a result of a series of events and his natural talent for flying. Here are the key points that led to his involvement:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Professor McGonagall's Intervention</strong>: Harry was approached by Professor McGonagall after he performed impressively on a broomstick during a flying lesson. She recognized his potential and offered him a position on the Gryffindor Quidditch team. This was notable because he would be the youngest House player in about a century. (Book 1, Chapter 9)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Training and Preparation</strong>: Once Harry was on the team, he began rigorous training under the guidance of Oliver Wood, the team captain. Wood was determined that Gryffindor would win the Quidditch Cup that year. Harry's training involved frequent practices and a significant commitment of time, alongside his homework. (Book 1, Chapter 10)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Quidditch Matches</strong>: Harry's excitement grew as the season progressed, culminating in his first match against Slytherin, which was a significant event in the school. The atmosphere around the Quidditch pitch was electric, with many students supporting the team. (Book 1, Chapter 11)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Support from Friends</strong>: His friends, particularly Ron and Hermione, were supportive during this transition, helping to prepare him for his role as Seeker. They had even created a banner for his first match, showing their enthusiasm for his participation. (Book 1, Chapter 11)</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>These events combined to set the stage for Harry's successful entry into the world of Quidditch at Hogwarts.</p></td><td><p>I don't have enough information to answer the question about the events that led to Harry joining the Quidditch team.</p></td></tr><tr><td>Based on what we've seen so far, why might the Sorting Hat have considered putting Harry in Slytherin?</td><td><p>The Sorting Hat might have considered putting Harry in Slytherin for a couple of reasons related to the traits associated with that house. Here are some supporting excerpts:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The Sorting Hat describes Slytherin as a place where "you’ll make your real friends," and mentions that "those cunning folk use any means to achieve their ends." This suggests that the Hat recognizes traits like cunning and resourcefulness, which may align with aspects of Harry's personality (Book 1, Chapter 7).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The overall context of the Sorting Ceremony indicates that the Hat has the ability to see into a person's mind and discern their qualities. Since Harry possesses a mixture of bravery, ambition, and potential for cunning, it is plausible that these traits would make him a candidate for Slytherin, despite his eventual placement in Gryffindor (Book 1, Chapter 7).</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>These points highlight why the Sorting Hat might have considered Slytherin as a possible option for Harry.</p></td><td><p>The Sorting Hat considered putting Harry in Slytherin due to several qualities it recognized in him, alongside Harry's own strong feelings against it. Here are some key points from the context:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Potential for Greatness</strong>: When Harry first tried on the Sorting Hat, it noted, "You could be great, you know, it’s all here in your head, and Slytherin would help you on the way to greatness" (Book 2, Chapter 9). This indicates that the Hat saw potential in Harry that aligned with Slytherin's values.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Qualities Valued by Slytherin</strong>: Dumbledore points out that Harry possesses several traits that Salazar Slytherin prized, including "Parseltongue, resourcefulness, determination, and a certain disregard for rules" (Book 2, Chapter 18). These characteristics are often associated with Slytherin House.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Harry's Choice</strong>: Ultimately, Harry's own wish to avoid Slytherin influenced the Sorting Hat's decision. When he expressed his desire not to be sorted into Slytherin, the Hat responded, "Oh, well, if you’re sure … better be Gryffindor" (Book 2, Chapter 9). This shows that the Hat takes the individual’s preferences into account during the sorting process.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Self-Reflection</strong>: In a moment of self-doubt, Harry reflects, "It only put me in Gryffindor because I asked not to go in Slytherin" (Book 2, Chapter 18), highlighting his awareness that his own choices played a crucial role in the Sorting process.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>These points illustrate that the Sorting Hat saw qualities in Harry that could lead him to Slytherin but ultimately respected his choice to be placed in Gryffindor.</p></td></tr><tr><td>What do we know about the Chamber of Secrets?</td><td><p>I don't have enough information to answer the question about the Chamber of Secrets.</p></td><td><ul>
<li>The Chamber of Secrets is referenced as having been opened, with ominous messages warning "ENEMIES OF THE HEIR, BEWARE" found on the walls (Book 2, Chapter 8).</li>
<li>Ron questions the existence of the Chamber, and Hermione expresses her doubts about the nature of the creature that attacked Mrs. Norris, suggesting it might not be human (Book 2, Chapter 9).</li>
<li>Hermione actively seeks information about the Chamber of Secrets during a lecture with Professor Binns, indicating it is a topic of interest and concern among students (Book 2, Chapter 9).</li>
<li>Ron reflects on the missed opportunity to ask Moaning Myrtle about the Chamber, highlighting the proximity of the Chamber's location to their previous encounters (Book 2, Chapter 16). </li>
</ul>
<p>Overall, the Chamber of Secrets is portrayed as a mysterious and dangerous place, with significant implications for the characters involved.</p></td></tr></table></div><div><table><tr><th>Question</th><th>Book 1</th><th>Book 7</th></tr><tr><td>What is Harry's aunt and uncle's address?</td><td><p>Book 1, Chapter 17: “Busy year?” she said. “Very,” said Harry. “Thanks for the fudge and the sweater, Mrs. Weasley.” “Oh, it was nothing, dear.” “Ready, are you?” It was Uncle Vernon, still purple-faced, still mustached, still looking furious at the nerve of Harry, carrying an owl in a cage in a station full of ordinary people. Behind him stood Aunt Petunia and Dudley, looking terrified at the very sight of Harry. “You must be Harry’s family!” said Mrs. Weasley. “In a manner of speaking,” said Uncle Vernon.</p>
<p>Book 1, Chapter 2: “We could phone Marge,” Uncle Vernon suggested. “Don’t be silly, Vernon, she hates the boy.” The Dursleys often spoke about Harry like this, as though he wasn’t there — or rather, as though he was something very nasty that couldn’t understand them, like a slug. “What about what’s-her-name, your friend — Yvonne?” “On vacation in Majorca,” snapped Aunt Petunia. “You could just leave me here,” Harry put in hopefully (he’d be able to watch what he wanted on television for a change and maybe even have a go on Dudley’s computer). Aunt Petunia looked as though she’d just swallowed a lemon. “And come back and find the house in ruins?” she snarled. “I won’t blow up the house,” said Harry, but they weren’t listening.</p>
<p>Book 1, Chapter 6: He had decided to call her Hedwig, a name he had found in A History of Magic. His school books were very interesting. He lay on his bed reading late into the night, Hedwig swooping in and out of the open window as she pleased. It was lucky that Aunt Petunia didn’t come in to vacuum anymore, because Hedwig kept bringing back dead mice. Every night before he went to sleep, Harry ticked off another day on the piece of paper he had pinned to the wall, counting down to September the first. On the last day of August he thought he’d better speak to his aunt and uncle about getting to King’s Cross station the next day, so he went down to the living room where they were watching a quiz show on television.</p>
<p>Book 1, Chapter 3: Who would? He had no friends, no other relatives — he didn’t belong to the library, so he’d never even got rude notes asking for books back. Yet here it was, a letter, addressed so plainly there could be no mistake: Mr. H. Potter The Cupboard under the Stairs 4 Privet Drive Little Whinging Surrey The envelope was thick and heavy, made of yellowish parchment, and the address was written in emerald-green ink. There was no stamp. Turning the envelope over, his hand trembling, Harry saw a purple wax seal bearing a coat of arms; a lion, an eagle, a badger, and a snake surrounding a large letter H. “Hurry up, boy!” shouted Uncle Vernon from the kitchen. “What are you doing, checking for letter bombs?” He chuckled at his own joke. Harry went back to the kitchen, still staring at his letter.</p>
<p>Book 1, Chapter 17: “You must come and stay this summer,” said Ron, “both of you — I’ll send you an owl.” “Thanks,” said Harry, “I’ll need something to look forward to.” People jostled them as they moved forward toward the gateway back to the Muggle world. Some of them called: “Bye, Harry!” “See you, Potter!” “Still famous,” said Ron, grinning at him. “Not where I’m going, I promise you,” said Harry. He, Ron, and Hermione passed through the gateway together. “There he is, Mom, there he is, look!” It was Ginny Weasley, Ron’s younger sister, but she wasn’t pointing at Ron. “Harry Potter!” she squealed. “Look, Mom! I can see —” “Be quiet, Ginny, and it’s rude to point.” Mrs. Weasley smiled down at them.</p></td><td><p>Book 1, Chapter 17: “Busy year?” she said. “Very,” said Harry. “Thanks for the fudge and the sweater, Mrs. Weasley.” “Oh, it was nothing, dear.” “Ready, are you?” It was Uncle Vernon, still purple-faced, still mustached, still looking furious at the nerve of Harry, carrying an owl in a cage in a station full of ordinary people. Behind him stood Aunt Petunia and Dudley, looking terrified at the very sight of Harry. “You must be Harry’s family!” said Mrs. Weasley. “In a manner of speaking,” said Uncle Vernon.</p>
<p>Book 4, Chapter 12: “Hiya, Harry!” It was Colin Creevey, a third year to whom Harry was something of a hero. “Hi, Colin,” said Harry warily. “Harry, guess what? Guess what, Harry? My brother’s starting! My brother Dennis!” “Er — good,” said Harry. “He’s really excited!” said Colin, practically bouncing up and down in his seat. “I just hope he’s in Gryffindor! Keep your fingers crossed, eh, Harry?” “Er — yeah, all right,” said Harry. He turned back to Hermione, Ron, and Nearly Headless Nick. “Brothers and sisters usually go in the same Houses, don’t they?” he said.</p>
<p>Book 2, Chapter 1: The moment he had finished, Aunt Petunia whisked away his plate. “Upstairs! Hurry!” As he passed the door to the living room, Harry caught a glimpse of Uncle Vernon and Dudley in bow ties and dinner jackets. He had only just reached the upstairs landing when the doorbell rang and Uncle Vernon’s furious face appeared at the foot of the stairs. “Remember, boy — one sound —” Harry crossed to his bedroom on tiptoe, slipped inside, closed the door, and turned to collapse on his bed. The trouble was, there was already someone sitting on it.</p>
<p>Book 5, Chapter 4: …” “What d’you mean?” “Remember old Fleur Delacour?” said George. “She’s got a job at Gringotts to eemprove ’er Eeenglish —” “— and Bill’s been giving her a lot of private lessons,” sniggered Fred. “Charlie’s in the Order too,” said George, “but he’s still in Romania, Dumbledore wants as many foreign wizards brought in as possible, so Charlie’s trying to make contacts on his days off.” “Couldn’t Percy do that?” Harry asked. The last he had heard, the third Weasley brother was working in the Department of International Magical Cooperation at the Ministry of Magic. At these words all the Weasleys and Hermione exchanged darkly significant looks. “Whatever you do, don’t mention Percy in front of Mum and Dad,” Ron told Harry in a tense voice. “Why not?” “Because every time Percy’s name’s mentioned, Dad breaks whatever he’s holding and Mum starts crying,” Fred said. “It’s been awful,” said Ginny sadly. “I think we’re well shut of him,” said George with an uncharacteristically ugly look on his face.</p>
<p>Book 4, Chapter 4: They were still gaping at Mr. Weasley, thunderstruck. Aunt Petunia staggered upright again and hid behind Uncle Vernon. “Hello, Harry!” said Mr. Weasley brightly. “Got your trunk ready?” “It’s upstairs,” said Harry, grinning back.</p></td></tr><tr><td>What is the name for a person who can talk to snakes?</td><td><p>Book 1, Chapter 2: The snake jabbed its tail at a little sign next to the glass. Harry peered at it. Boa Constrictor, Brazil. “Was it nice there?” The boa constrictor jabbed its tail at the sign again and Harry read on: This specimen was bred in the zoo. “Oh, I see — so you’ve never been to Brazil?” As the snake shook its head, a deafening shout behind Harry made both of them jump. “DUDLEY! MR. DURSLEY! COME AND LOOK AT THIS SNAKE! YOU WON’T BELIEVE WHAT IT’S DOING!” Dudley came waddling toward them as fast as he could. “Out of the way, you,” he said, punching Harry in the ribs.</p>
<p>Book 1, Chapter 2: Then he looked quickly around to see if anyone was watching. They weren’t. He looked back at the snake and winked, too. The snake jerked its head toward Uncle Vernon and Dudley, then raised its eyes to the ceiling. It gave Harry a look that said quite plainly: “I get that all the time.” “I know,” Harry murmured through the glass, though he wasn’t sure the snake could hear him. “It must be really annoying.” The snake nodded vigorously. “Where do you come from, anyway?” Harry asked.</p>
<p>Book 1, Chapter 2: As the snake slid swiftly past him, Harry could have sworn a low, hissing voice said, “Brazil, here I come. … Thanksss, amigo.” The keeper of the reptile house was in shock. “But the glass,” he kept saying, “where did the glass go?” The zoo director himself made Aunt Petunia a cup of strong, sweet tea while he apologized over and over again. Piers and Dudley could only gibber. As far as Harry had seen, the snake hadn’t done anything except snap playfully at their heels as it passed, but by the time they were all back in Uncle Vernon’s car, Dudley was telling them how it had nearly bitten off his leg, while Piers was swearing it had tried to squeeze him to death. But worst of all, for Harry at least, was Piers calming down enough to say, “Harry was talking to it, weren’t you, Harry?” Uncle Vernon waited until Piers was safely out of the house before starting on Harry. He was so angry he could hardly speak. He managed to say, “Go — cupboard — stay — no meals,” before he collapsed into a chair, and Aunt Petunia had to run and get him a large brandy. Harry lay in his dark cupboard much later, wishing he had a watch. He didn’t know what time it was and he couldn’t be sure the Dursleys were asleep yet. Until they were, he couldn’t risk sneaking to the kitchen for some food. He’d lived with the Dursleys almost ten years, ten miserable years, as long as he could remember, ever since he’d been a baby and his parents had died in that car crash. He couldn’t remember being in the car when his parents had died. Sometimes, when he strained his memory during long hours in his cupboard, he came up with a strange vision: a blinding flash of green light and a burning pain on his forehead. This, he supposed, was the crash, though he couldn’t imagine where all the green light came from. He couldn’t remember his parents at all. His aunt and uncle never spoke about them, and of course he was forbidden to ask questions.</p>
<p>Book 1, Chapter 2: Caught by surprise, Harry fell hard on the concrete floor. What came next happened so fast no one saw how it happened — one second, Piers and Dudley were leaning right up close to the glass, the next, they had leapt back with howls of horror. Harry sat up and gasped; the glass front of the boa constrictor’s tank had vanished. The great snake was uncoiling itself rapidly, slithering out onto the floor. People throughout the reptile house screamed and started running for the exits.</p>
<p>Book 1, Chapter 2: It wasn’t bad, either, Harry thought, licking it as they watched a gorilla scratching its head who looked remarkably like Dudley, except that it wasn’t blond. Harry had the best morning he’d had in a long time. He was careful to walk a little way apart from the Dursleys so that Dudley and Piers, who were starting to get bored with the animals by lunchtime, wouldn’t fall back on their favorite hobby of hitting him. They ate in the zoo restaurant, and when Dudley had a tantrum because his knickerbocker glory didn’t have enough ice cream on top, Uncle Vernon bought him another one and Harry was allowed to finish the first. Harry felt, afterward, that he should have known it was all too good to last. After lunch they went to the reptile house. It was cool and dark in there, with lit windows all along the walls. Behind the glass, all sorts of lizards and snakes were crawling and slithering over bits of wood and stone. Dudley and Piers wanted to see huge, poisonous cobras and thick, man-crushing pythons. Dudley quickly found the largest snake in the place. It could have wrapped its body twice around Uncle Vernon’s car and crushed it into a trash can — but at the moment it didn’t look in the mood. In fact, it was fast asleep. Dudley stood with his nose pressed against the glass, staring at the glistening brown coils. “Make it move,” he whined at his father. Uncle Vernon tapped on the glass, but the snake didn’t budge. “Do it again,” Dudley ordered. Uncle Vernon rapped the glass smartly with his knuckles, but the snake just snoozed on. “This is boring,” Dudley moaned. He shuffled away. Harry moved in front of the tank and looked intently at the snake. He wouldn’t have been surprised if it had died of boredom itself — no company except stupid people drumming their fingers on the glass trying to disturb it all day long. It was worse than having a cupboard as a bedroom, where the only visitor was Aunt Petunia hammering on the door to wake you up; at least he got to visit the rest of the house. The snake suddenly opened its beady eyes. Slowly, very slowly, it raised its head until its eyes were on a level with Harry’s. It winked. Harry stared.</p></td><td><p>Book 6, Chapter 13: Taking it, Riddle said, “I can speak to snakes. I found out when we’ve been to the country on trips — they find me, they whisper to me. Is that normal for a wizard?” Harry could tell that he had withheld mention of this strangest power until that moment, determined to impress. “It is unusual,” said Dumbledore, after a moment’s hesitation, “but not unheard of.” His tone was casual but his eyes moved curiously over Riddle’s face. They stood for a moment, man and boy, staring at each other.</p>
<p>Book 2, Chapter 11: “You can talk to snakes!” “I know,” said Harry. “I mean, that’s only the second time I’ve ever done it. I accidentally set a boa constrictor on my cousin Dudley at the zoo once — long story — but it was telling me it had never seen Brazil and I sort of set it free without meaning to — that was before I knew I was a wizard —” “A boa constrictor told you it had never seen Brazil?” Ron repeated faintly. “So?” said Harry. “I bet loads of people here can do it.” “Oh, no they can’t,” said Ron. “It’s not a very common gift.</p>
<p>Book 4, Chapter 31: It was all hushed up, though. But he’s made friends with werewolves and giants too. We think he’d do anything for a bit of power.” Parseltongue, the ability to converse with snakes, has long been considered a Dark Art. Indeed, the most famous Parselmouth of our times is none other than You-Know-Who himself. A member of the Dark Force Defense League, who wished to remain unnamed, stated that he would regard any wizard who could speak Parseltongue “as worthy of investigation. Personally, I would be highly suspicious of anybody who could converse with snakes, as serpents are often used in the worst kinds of Dark Magic, and are historically associated with evildoers.” Similarly, “anyone who seeks out the company of such vicious creatures as werewolves and giants would appear to have a fondness for violence.” Albus Dumbledore should surely consider whether a boy such as this should be allowed to compete in the Triwizard Tournament. Some fear that Potter might resort to the Dark Arts in his desperation to win the tournament, the third task of which takes place this evening. “Gone off me a bit, hasn’t she?” said Harry lightly, folding up the paper. Over at the Slytherin table, Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle were laughing at him, tapping their heads with their fingers, pulling grotesquely mad faces, and waggling their tongues like snakes. “How did she know your scar hurt in Divination?” Ron said. “There’s no way she was there, there’s no way she could’ve heard —” “The window was open,” said Harry.</p>
<p>Book 2, Chapter 11: Harry, this is bad.” “What’s bad?” said Harry, starting to feel quite angry. “What’s wrong with everyone? Listen, if I hadn’t told that snake not to attack Justin —” “Oh, that’s what you said to it?” “What d’you mean? You were there — you heard me —” “I heard you speaking Parseltongue,” said Ron. “Snake language. You could have been saying anything — no wonder Justin panicked, you sounded like you were egging the snake on or something — it was creepy, you know —” Harry gaped at him. “I spoke a different language? But — I didn’t realize — how can I speak a language without knowing I can speak it?” Ron shook his head. Both he and Hermione were looking as though someone had died. Harry couldn’t see what was so terrible.</p>
<p>Book 2, Chapter 11: “D’you want to tell me what’s wrong with stopping a massive snake biting off Justin’s head?” he said. “What does it matter how I did it as long as Justin doesn’t have to join the Headless Hunt?” “It matters,” said Hermione, speaking at last in a hushed voice, “because being able to talk to snakes was what Salazar Slytherin was famous for. That’s why the symbol of Slytherin House is a serpent.” Harry’s mouth fell open. “Exactly,” said Ron.</p></td></tr><tr><td>How does Hermione's attitude toward house rules change from when we first meet her to now?</td><td><p>Book 1, Chapter 10: The common room was packed and noisy. Everyone was eating the food that had been sent up. Hermione, however, stood alone by the door, waiting for them. There was a very embarrassed pause. Then, none of them looking at each other, they all said “Thanks,” and hurried off to get plates. But from that moment on, Hermione Granger became their friend. There are some things you can’t share without ending up liking each other, and knocking out a twelve-foot mountain troll is one of them.</p>
<p>Book 1, Chapter 9: Hermione wasn’t going to give up that easily. She followed Ron through the portrait hole, hissing at them like an angry goose. “Don’t you care about Gryffindor, do you only care about yourselves, I don’t want Slytherin to win the House Cup, and you’ll lose all the points I got from Professor McGonagall for knowing about Switching Spells.” “Go away.” “All right, but I warned you, you just remember what I said when you’re on the train home tomorrow, you’re so —” But what they were, they didn’t find out. Hermione had turned to the portrait of the Fat Lady to get back inside and found herself facing an empty painting. The Fat Lady had gone on a nighttime visit and Hermione was locked out of Gryffindor Tower. “Now what am I going to do?” she asked shrilly. “That’s your problem,” said Ron.</p>
<p>Book 1, Chapter 14: She had started drawing up study schedules and color-coding all her notes. Harry and Ron wouldn’t have minded, but she kept nagging them to do the same. “Hermione, the exams are ages away.” “Ten weeks,” Hermione snapped. “That’s not ages, that’s like a second to Nicolas Flamel.” “But we’re not six hundred years old,” Ron reminded her. “Anyway, what are you studying for, you already know it all.” “What am I studying for? Are you crazy?</p>
<p>Book 1, Chapter 10: “I think she heard you.” “So?” said Ron, but he looked a bit uncomfortable. “She must’ve noticed she’s got no friends.” Hermione didn’t turn up for the next class and wasn’t seen all afternoon. On their way down to the Great Hall for the Halloween feast, Harry and Ron overheard Parvati Patil telling her friend Lavender that Hermione was crying in the girls’ bathroom and wanted to be left alone. Ron looked still more awkward at this, but a moment later they had entered the Great Hall, where the Halloween decorations put Hermione out of their minds. A thousand live bats fluttered from the walls and ceiling while a thousand more swooped over the tables in low black clouds, making the candles in the pumpkins stutter. The feast appeared suddenly on the golden plates, as it had at the start-of-term banquet.</p>
<p>Book 1, Chapter 17: “You must come and stay this summer,” said Ron, “both of you — I’ll send you an owl.” “Thanks,” said Harry, “I’ll need something to look forward to.” People jostled them as they moved forward toward the gateway back to the Muggle world. Some of them called: “Bye, Harry!” “See you, Potter!” “Still famous,” said Ron, grinning at him. “Not where I’m going, I promise you,” said Harry. He, Ron, and Hermione passed through the gateway together. “There he is, Mom, there he is, look!” It was Ginny Weasley, Ron’s younger sister, but she wasn’t pointing at Ron. “Harry Potter!” she squealed. “Look, Mom! I can see —” “Be quiet, Ginny, and it’s rude to point.” Mrs. Weasley smiled down at them.</p></td><td><p>Book 5, Chapter 29: “And how are you going to get in there in the first place?” Harry was ready for this question. “Sirius’s knife,” he said. “Excuse me?” “Christmas before last Sirius gave me a knife that’ll open any lock,” said Harry. “So even if she’s bewitched the door so Alohomora won’t work, which I bet she has —” “What do you think about this?” Hermione demanded of Ron, and Harry was reminded irresistibly of Mrs. Weasley appealing to her husband during Harry’s first dinner in Grimmauld Place. “I dunno,” said Ron, looking alarmed at being asked to give an opinion. “If Harry wants to do it, it’s up to him, isn’t it?” “Spoken like a true friend and Weasley,” said Fred, clapping Ron hard on the back.</p>
<p>Book 6, Chapter 5: “Well, I’d better get on. … Eat your eggs while they’re warm, Harry.” Looking careworn, she left the room. Ron still seemed slightly punch-drunk; he was shaking his head experimentally like a dog trying to rid its ears of water. “Don’t you get used to her if she’s staying in the same house?” Harry asked. “Well, you do,” said Ron, “but if she jumps out at you unexpectedly, like then …” “It’s pathetic,” said Hermione furiously, striding away from Ron as far as she could go and turning to face him with her arms folded once she had reached the wall. “You don’t really want her around forever?” Ginny asked Ron incredulously. When he merely shrugged, she said, “Well, Mum’s going to put a stop to it if she can, I bet you anything.” “How’s she going to manage that?” asked Harry. “She keeps trying to get Tonks round for dinner.</p>
<p>Book 4, Chapter 9: That Mr. Crouch made her go up to the top of the stadium, and she was terrified, and he’s got her bewitched so she can’t even run when they start trampling tents! Why doesn’t anyone do something about it?” “Well, the elves are happy, aren’t they?” Ron said. “You heard old Winky back at the match … ‘House-elves is not supposed to have fun’ … that’s what she likes, being bossed around. …” “It’s people like you, Ron,” Hermione began hotly, “who prop up rotten and unjust systems, just because they’re too lazy to —” Another loud bang echoed from the edge of the wood. “Let’s just keep moving, shall we?” said Ron, and Harry saw him glance edgily at Hermione. Perhaps there was truth in what Malfoy had said; perhaps Hermione was in more danger than they were.</p>
<p>Book 4, Chapter 9: Hermione rounded on him. “That doesn’t mean she hasn’t got feelings, Ron. It’s disgusting the way —” “Hermione, I agree with you,” said Mr. Weasley quickly, beckoning her on, “but now is not the time to discuss elf rights. I want to get back to the tent as fast as we can. What happened to the others?” “We lost them in the dark,” said Ron.</p>
<p>Book 6, Chapter 21: “Have you been up at the Room of Requirement all this time?” “Yep,” said Harry. “And guess who I ran into up there? Tonks!” “Tonks?” repeated Ron and Hermione together, looking surprised. “Yeah, she said she’d come to visit Dumbledore. …” “If you ask me,” said Ron once Harry had finished describing his conversation with Tonks, “she’s cracking up a bit. Losing her nerve after what happened at the Ministry.” “It’s a bit odd,” said Hermione, who for some reason looked very concerned. “She’s supposed to be guarding the school, why’s she suddenly abandoning her post to come and see Dumbledore when he’s not even here?” “I had a thought,” said Harry tentatively. He felt strange about voicing it; this was much more Hermione’s territory than his. “You don’t think she can have been … you know … in love with Sirius?” Hermione stared at him. “What on earth makes you say that?” “I dunno,” said Harry, shrugging, “but she was nearly crying when I mentioned his name … and her Patronus is a big four-legged thing now. … I wondered whether it hadn’t become … you know … him.” “It’s a thought,” said Hermione slowly. “But I still don’t know why she’d be bursting into the castle to see Dumbledore, if that’s really why she was here. …” “Goes back to what I said, doesn’t it?” said Ron, who was now shoveling mashed potato into his mouth. “She’s gone a bit funny. Lost her nerve. Women,” he said wisely to Harry, “they’re easily upset.” “And yet,” said Hermione, coming out of her reverie, “I doubt you’d find a woman who sulked for half an hour because Madam Rosmerta didn’t laugh at their joke about the hag, the Healer, and the Mimbulus mimbletonia.” Ron scowled.</p></td></tr><tr><td>What events led to Harry joining the Quidditch team?</td><td><p>Book 1, Chapter 11: He didn’t know how he’d have gotten through all his homework without her, what with all the last-minute Quidditch practice Wood was making them do. She had also lent him Quidditch Through the Ages, which turned out to be a very interesting read. Harry learned that there were seven hundred ways of committing a Quidditch foul and that all of them had happened during a World Cup match in 1473; that Seekers were usually the smallest and fastest players, and that most serious Quidditch accidents seemed to happen to them; that although people rarely died playing Quidditch, referees had been known to vanish and turn up months later in the Sahara Desert. Hermione had become a bit more relaxed about breaking rules since Harry and Ron had saved her from the mountain troll, and she was much nicer for it. The day before Harry’s first Quidditch match the three of them were out in the freezing courtyard during break, and she had conjured them up a bright blue fire that could be carried around in a jam jar.</p>
<p>Book 1, Chapter 9: “Your father would have been proud,” she said. “He was an excellent Quidditch player himself.” “You’re joking.” It was dinnertime. Harry had just finished telling Ron what had happened when he’d left the grounds with Professor McGonagall. Ron had a piece of steak and kidney pie halfway to his mouth, but he’d forgotten all about it. “Seeker?” he said. “But first years never — you must be the youngest House player in about —” “— a century,” said Harry, shoveling pie into his mouth. He felt particularly hungry after the excitement of the afternoon. “Wood told me.” Ron was so amazed, so impressed, he just sat and gaped at Harry.</p>
<p>Book 1, Chapter 11: Chapter 11 Quidditch As they entered November, the weather turned very cold. The mountains around the school became icy gray and the lake like chilled steel. Every morning the ground was covered in frost. Hagrid could be seen from the upstairs windows defrosting broomsticks on the Quidditch field, bundled up in a long moleskin overcoat, rabbit fur gloves, and enormous beaverskin boots. The Quidditch season had begun. On Saturday, Harry would be playing in his first match after weeks of training: Gryffindor versus Slytherin.</p>
<p>Book 1, Chapter 10: After half an hour, night had really fallen and they couldn’t carry on. “That Quidditch Cup’ll have our name on it this year,” said Wood happily as they trudged back up to the castle. “I wouldn’t be surprised if you turn out better than Charlie Weasley, and he could have played for England if he hadn’t gone off chasing dragons.” Perhaps it was because he was now so busy, what with Quidditch practice three evenings a week on top of all his homework, but Harry could hardly believe it when he realized that he’d already been at Hogwarts two months. The castle felt more like home than Privet Drive ever had. His lessons, too, were becoming more and more interesting now that they had mastered the basics. On Halloween morning they woke to the delicious smell of baking pumpkin wafting through the corridors. Even better, Professor Flitwick announced in Charms that he thought they were ready to start making objects fly, something they had all been dying to try since they’d seen him make Neville’s toad zoom around the classroom. Professor Flitwick put the class into pairs to practice. Harry’s partner was Seamus Finnigan (which was a relief, because Neville had been trying to catch his eye).</p>
<p>Book 1, Chapter 11: In an hour’s time he’d be walking onto the field. “Harry, you need your strength,” said Seamus Finnigan. “Seekers are always the ones who get clobbered by the other team.” “Thanks, Seamus,” said Harry, watching Seamus pile ketchup on his sausages. By eleven o’clock the whole school seemed to be out in the stands around the Quidditch pitch. Many students had binoculars. The seats might be raised high in the air, but it was still difficult to see what was going on sometimes. Ron and Hermione joined Neville, Seamus, and Dean the West Ham fan up in the top row. As a surprise for Harry, they had painted a large banner on one of the sheets Scabbers had ruined.</p></td><td><p>Book 3, Chapter 16: Chapter 16 Professor Trelawney’s Prediction Harry’s euphoria at finally winning the Quidditch Cup lasted at least a week. Even the weather seemed to be celebrating; as June approached, the days became cloudless and sultry, and all anybody felt like doing was strolling onto the grounds and flopping down on the grass with several pints of iced pumpkin juice, perhaps playing a casual game of Gobstones or watching the giant squid propel itself dreamily across the surface of the lake. But they couldn’t.</p>
<p>Book 3, Chapter 9: “Stand and fight, you mangy cur!” yelled Sir Cadogan. “Oh, shut up,” Harry yawned. He revived a bit over a large bowl of porridge, and by the time he’d started on toast, the rest of the team had turned up. “It’s going to be a tough one,” said Wood, who wasn’t eating anything. “Stop worrying, Oliver,” said Alicia soothingly, “we don’t mind a bit of rain.” But it was considerably more than a bit of rain. Such was the popularity of Quidditch that the whole school turned out to watch the match as usual, but they ran down the lawns toward the Quidditch field, heads bowed against the ferocious wind, umbrellas being whipped out of their hands as they went. Just before he entered the locker room, Harry saw Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle, laughing and pointing at him from under an enormous umbrella on their way to the stadium. The team changed into their scarlet robes and waited for Wood’s usual pre-match pep talk, but it didn’t come. He tried to speak several times, made an odd gulping noise, then shook his head hopelessly and beckoned them to follow him. The wind was so strong that they staggered sideways as they walked out onto the field.</p>
<p>Book 4, Chapter 28: Please don’t bother me again unless it’s something important. Happy Easter. The start of the summer term would normally have meant that Harry was training hard for the last Quidditch match of the season. This year, however, it was the third and final task in the Triwizard Tournament for which he needed to prepare, but he still didn’t know what he would have to do. Finally, in the last week of May, Professor McGonagall held him back in Transfiguration. “You are to go down to the Quidditch field tonight at nine o’clock, Potter,” she told him. “Mr. Bagman will be there to tell the champions about the third task.” So at half past eight that night, Harry left Ron and Hermione in Gryffindor Tower and went downstairs. As he crossed the entrance hall, Cedric came up from the Hufflepuff common room. “What d’you reckon it’s going to be?” he asked Harry as they went together down the stone steps, out into the cloudy night.</p>
<p>Book 4, Chapter 8: Chapter 8 The Quidditch World Cup Clutching their purchases, Mr. Weasley in the lead, they all hurried into the wood, following the lantern-lit trail. They could hear the sounds of thousands of people moving around them, shouts and laughter, snatches of singing. The atmosphere of feverish excitement was highly infectious; Harry couldn’t stop grinning.</p>
<p>Book 6, Chapter 19: “Jus’ don’ believe it … Look at him lyin’ there. … Who’d want ter hurt him, eh?” “That’s just what we were discussing,” said Harry. “We don’t know.” “Someone couldn’ have a grudge against the Gryffindor Quidditch team, could they?” said Hagrid anxiously. “Firs’ Katie, now Ron …” “I can’t see anyone trying to bump off a Quidditch team,” said George. “Wood might’ve done the Slytherins if he could’ve got away with it,” said Fred fairly. “Well, I don’t think it’s Quidditch, but I think there’s a connection between the attacks,” said Hermione quietly. “How d’you work that out?” asked Fred.</p></td></tr><tr><td>Based on what we've seen so far, why might the Sorting Hat have considered putting Harry in Slytherin?</td><td><p>Book 1, Chapter 7: You can keep your bowlers black, Your top hats sleek and tall, For I’m the Hogwarts Sorting Hat And I can cap them all. There’s nothing hidden in your head The Sorting Hat can’t see, So try me on and I will tell you Where you ought to be. You might belong in Gryffindor, Where dwell the brave at heart, Their daring, nerve, and chivalry Set Gryffindors apart; You might belong in Hufflepuff, Where they are just and loyal, Those patient Hufflepuffs are true And unafraid of toil; Or yet in wise old Ravenclaw, If you’ve a ready mind, Where those of wit and learning, Will always find their kind; Or perhaps in Slytherin You’ll make your real friends, Those cunning folk use any means To achieve their ends. So put me on! Don’t be afraid!</p>
<p>Book 1, Chapter 7: Chapter 7 The Sorting Hat The door swung open at once. A tall, black-haired witch in emerald-green robes stood there. She had a very stern face and Harry’s first thought was that this was not someone to cross. “The firs’ years, Professor McGonagall,” said Hagrid.</p>
<p>Book 1, Chapter 7: The Sorting is a very important ceremony because, while you are here, your House will be something like your family within Hogwarts. You will have classes with the rest of your House, sleep in your House dormitory, and spend free time in your House common room. “The four Houses are called Gryffindor, Hufflepuff, Ravenclaw, and Slytherin. Each House has its own noble history and each has produced outstanding witches and wizards. While you are at Hogwarts, your triumphs will earn your House points, while any rule-breaking will lose House points. At the end of the year, the House with the most points is awarded the House cup, a great honor. I hope each of you will be a credit to whichever House becomes yours. “The Sorting Ceremony will take place in a few minutes in front of the rest of the school. I suggest you all smarten yourselves up as much as you can while you are waiting.” Her eyes lingered for a moment on Neville’s cloak, which was fastened under his left ear, and on Ron’s smudged nose. Harry nervously tried to flatten his hair.</p>
<p>Book 1, Chapter 7: This hat was patched and frayed and extremely dirty. Aunt Petunia wouldn’t have let it in the house. Maybe they had to try and get a rabbit out of it, Harry thought wildly, that seemed the sort of thing — noticing that everyone in the hall was now staring at the hat, he stared at it, too. For a few seconds, there was complete silence. Then the hat twitched. A rip near the brim opened wide like a mouth — and the hat began to sing: “Oh, you may not think I’m pretty, But don’t judge on what you see, I’ll eat myself if you can find A smarter hat than me.</p>
<p>Book 1, Chapter 7: He remembered being picked for teams during gym at his old school. He had always been last to be chosen, not because he was no good, but because no one wanted Dudley to think they liked him. “Finch-Fletchley, Justin!” “HUFFLEPUFF!” Sometimes, Harry noticed, the hat shouted out the House at once, but at others it took a little while to decide. “Finnigan, Seamus,” the sandy-haired boy next to Harry in the line, sat on the stool for almost a whole minute before the hat declared him a Gryffindor. “Granger, Hermione!” Hermione almost ran to the stool and jammed the hat eagerly on her head. “GRYFFINDOR!” shouted the hat.</p></td><td><p>Book 2, Chapter 9: …” Hermione nodded fervently, but Harry didn’t say anything. His stomach had just dropped unpleasantly. Harry had never told Ron and Hermione that the Sorting Hat had seriously considered putting him in Slytherin. He could remember, as though it were yesterday, the small voice that had spoken in his ear when he’d placed the hat on his head a year before: You could be great, you know, it’s all here in your head, and Slytherin would help you on the way to greatness, no doubt about that. … But Harry, who had already heard of Slytherin House’s reputation for turning out Dark wizards, had thought desperately, Not Slytherin! and the hat had said, Oh, well, if you’re sure … better be Gryffindor.</p>
<p>Book 2, Chapter 18: “It certainly seems so.” “So I should be in Slytherin,” Harry said, looking desperately into Dumbledore’s face. “The Sorting Hat could see Slytherin’s power in me, and it —” “Put you in Gryffindor,” said Dumbledore calmly. “Listen to me, Harry. You happen to have many qualities Salazar Slytherin prized in his hand-picked students. His own very rare gift, Parseltongue — resourcefulness — determination — a certain disregard for rules,” he added, his mustache quivering again. “Yet the Sorting Hat placed you in Gryffindor. You know why that was. Think.” “It only put me in Gryffindor,” said Harry in a defeated voice, “because I asked not to go in Slytherin.</p>
<p>Book 7, Chapter 36: It doesn’t matter to us, Al. But if it matters to you, you’ll be able to choose Gryffindor over Slytherin. The Sorting Hat takes your choice into account.” “Really?” “It did for me,” said Harry. He had never told any of his children that before, and he saw the wonder in Albus’s face when he said it.</p>
<p>Book 5, Chapter 11: I have told you, I have warned you. … Let the Sorting now begin. The hat became motionless once more; applause broke out, though it was punctured, for the first time in Harry’s memory, with muttering and whispers. All across the Great Hall students were exchanging remarks with their neighbors and Harry, clapping along with everyone else, knew exactly what they were talking about. “Branched out a bit this year, hasn’t it?” said Ron, his eyebrows raised. “Too right it has,” said Harry. The Sorting Hat usually confined itself to describing the different qualities looked for by each of the four Hogwarts Houses and its own role in sorting them; Harry could not remember it ever trying to give the school advice before. “I wonder if it’s ever given warnings before?” said Hermione, sounding slightly anxious. “Yes, indeed,” said Nearly Headless Nick knowledgeably, leaning across Neville toward her (Neville winced, it was very uncomfortable to have a ghost lean through you). “The hat feels itself honor-bound to give the school due warning whenever it feels —” But Professor McGonagall, who was waiting to read out the list of first years’ names, was giving the whispering students the sort of look that scorches. Nearly Headless Nick placed a see-through finger to his lips and sat primly upright again as the muttering came to an abrupt end. With a last frowning look that swept the four House tables, Professor McGonagall lowered her eyes to her long piece of parchment and called out, “Abercrombie, Euan.” The terrified-looking boy Harry had noticed earlier stumbled forward and put the hat on his head; it was only prevented from falling right down to his shoulders by his very prominent ears. The hat considered for a moment, then the rip near the brim opened again and shouted, “GRYFFINDOR!” Harry clapped loudly with the rest of Gryffindor House as Euan Abercrombie staggered to their table and sat down, looking as though he would like very much to sink through the floor and never be looked at again. Slowly the long line of first years thinned; in the pauses between the names and the Sorting Hat’s decisions, Harry could hear Ron’s stomach rumbling loudly. Finally, “Zeller, Rose” was sorted into Hufflepuff, and Professor McGonagall picked up the hat and stool and marched them away as Professor Dumbledore rose to his feet. Harry was somehow soothed to see Dumbledore standing before them all, whatever his recent bitter feelings toward his headmaster. Between the absence of Hagrid and the presence of those dragonish horses, he had felt that his return to Hogwarts, so long anticipated, was full of unexpected surprises like jarring notes in a familiar song. But this, at least, was how it was supposed to be: their headmaster rising to greet them all before the start-of-term feast. “To our newcomers,” said Dumbledore in a ringing voice, his arms stretched wide and a beaming smile on his lips, “welcome!</p>
<p>Book 2, Chapter 9: “It is a myth! It does not exist! There is not a shred of evidence that Slytherin ever built so much as a secret broom cupboard! I regret telling you such a foolish story! We will return, if you please, to history, to solid, believable, verifiable fact!” And within five minutes, the class had sunk back into its usual torpor. “I always knew Salazar Slytherin was a twisted old loony,” Ron told Harry and Hermione as they fought their way through the teeming corridors at the end of the lesson to drop off their bags before dinner. “But I never knew he started all this pure-blood stuff. I wouldn’t be in his House if you paid me. Honestly, if the Sorting Hat had tried to put me in Slytherin, I’d’ve got the train straight back home.</p></td></tr><tr><td>What do we know about the Chamber of Secrets?</td><td><p>Book 1, Chapter 8: They were cold and empty and made you think of dark tunnels. “You are here to learn the subtle science and exact art of potion-making,” he began. He spoke in barely more than a whisper, but they caught every word — like Professor McGonagall, Snape had the gift of keeping a class silent without effort. “As there is little foolish wand-waving here, many of you will hardly believe this is magic. I don’t expect you will really understand the beauty of the softly simmering cauldron with its shimmering fumes, the delicate power of liquids that creep through human veins, bewitching the mind, ensnaring the senses. … I can teach you how to bottle fame, brew glory, even stopper death — if you aren’t as big a bunch of dunderheads as I usually have to teach.” More silence followed this little speech. Harry and Ron exchanged looks with raised eyebrows.</p>
<p>Book 1, Chapter 7: “Thank you, Hagrid. I will take them from here.” She pulled the door wide. The entrance hall was so big you could have fit the whole of the Dursleys’ house in it. The stone walls were lit with flaming torches like the ones at Gringotts, the ceiling was too high to make out, and a magnificent marble staircase facing them led to the upper floors. They followed Professor McGonagall across the flagged stone floor. Harry could hear the drone of hundreds of voices from a doorway to the right — the rest of the school must already be here — but Professor McGonagall showed the first years into a small, empty chamber off the hall. They crowded in, standing rather closer together than they would usually have done, peering about nervously. “Welcome to Hogwarts,” said Professor McGonagall. “The start-of-term banquet will begin shortly, but before you take your seats in the Great Hall, you will be sorted into your Houses.</p>
<p>Book 1, Chapter 5: “Got it,” said Hagrid at last, holding up a tiny golden key. The goblin looked at it closely. “That seems to be in order.” “An’ I’ve also got a letter here from Professor Dumbledore,” said Hagrid importantly, throwing out his chest. “It’s about the You-Know-What in vault seven hundred and thirteen.” The goblin read the letter carefully. “Very well,” he said, handing it back to Hagrid, “I will have someone take you down to both vaults. Griphook!” Griphook was yet another goblin. Once Hagrid had crammed all the dog biscuits back inside his pockets, he and Harry followed Griphook toward one of the doors leading off the hall. “What’s the You-Know-What in vault seven hundred and thirteen?” Harry asked. “Can’t tell yeh that,” said Hagrid mysteriously. “Very secret.</p>
<p>Book 1, Chapter 16: The next chamber was so dark they couldn’t see anything at all. But as they stepped into it, light suddenly flooded the room to reveal an astonishing sight. They were standing on the edge of a huge chessboard, behind the black chessmen, which were all taller than they were and carved from what looked like black stone. Facing them, way across the chamber, were the white pieces. Harry, Ron and Hermione shivered slightly — the towering white chessmen had no faces. “Now what do we do?” Harry whispered. “It’s obvious, isn’t it?” said Ron. “We’ve got to play our way across the room.” Behind the white pieces they could see another door. “How?” said Hermione nervously. “I think,” said Ron, “we’re going to have to be chessmen.” He walked up to a black knight and put his hand out to touch the knights horse. At once, the stone sprang to life. The horse pawed the ground and the knight turned his helmeted head to look down at Ron. “Do we — er — have to join you to get across?” The black knight nodded. Ron turned to the other two. “This needs thinking about. …” he said.</p>
<p>Book 1, Chapter 10: “It’s either really valuable or really dangerous,” said Ron. “Or both,” said Harry. But as all they knew for sure about the mysterious object was that it was about two inches long, they didn’t have much chance of guessing what it was without further clues. Neither Neville nor Hermione showed the slightest interest in what lay underneath the dog and the trapdoor. All Neville cared about was never going near the dog again.</p></td><td><p>Book 2, Chapter 8: They approached slowly, squinting through the darkness. Foot-high words had been daubed on the wall between two windows, shimmering in the light cast by the flaming torches. THE CHAMBER OF SECRETS HAS BEEN OPENED. ENEMIES OF THE HEIR, BEWARE. “What’s that thing — hanging underneath?” said Ron, a slight quiver in his voice.</p>
<p>Book 2, Chapter 9: “D’you really think there’s a Chamber of Secrets?” Ron asked Hermione. “I don’t know,” she said, frowning. “Dumbledore couldn’t cure Mrs. Norris, and that makes me think that whatever attacked her might not be — well — human.” As she spoke, they turned a corner and found themselves at the end of the very corridor where the attack had happened. They stopped and looked. The scene was just as it had been that night, except that there was no stiff cat hanging from the torch bracket, and an empty chair stood against the wall bearing the message “The Chamber of Secrets Has Been Opened.” “That’s where Filch has been keeping guard,” Ron muttered.</p>

<p>Book 2, Chapter 9: Professor Binns, glancing up in the middle of a deadly dull lecture on the International Warlock Convention of 1289, looked amazed. “Miss — er — ?” “Granger, Professor. I was wondering if you could tell us anything about the Chamber of Secrets,” said Hermione in a clear voice. Dean Thomas, who had been sitting with his mouth hanging open, gazing out of the window, jerked out of his trance; Lavender Brown’s head came up off her arms and Neville Longbottom’s elbow slipped off his desk. Professor Binns blinked.</p>
<p>Book 2, Chapter 16: Chapter 16 The Chamber of Secrets All those times we were in that bathroom, and she was just three toilets away,” said Ron bitterly at breakfast next day, “and we could’ve asked her, and now …” It had been hard enough trying to look for spiders. Escaping their teachers long enough to sneak into a girls’ bathroom, the girls’ bathroom, moreover, right next to the scene of the first attack, was going to be almost impossible. But something happened in their first lesson, Transfiguration, that drove the Chamber of Secrets out of their minds for the first time in weeks. Ten minutes into the class, Professor McGonagall told them that their exams would start on the first of June, one week from today. “Exams?” howled Seamus Finnigan. “We’re still getting exams?” There was a loud bang behind Harry as Neville Longbottom’s wand slipped, vanishing one of the legs on his desk. Professor McGonagall restored it with a wave of her own wand, and turned, frowning, to Seamus. “The whole point of keeping the school open at this time is for you to receive your education,” she said sternly. “The exams will therefore take place as usual, and I trust you are all studying hard.” Studying hard! It had never occurred to Harry that there would be exams with the castle in this state. There was a great deal of mutinous muttering around the room, which made Professor McGonagall scowl even more darkly. “Professor Dumbledore’s instructions were to keep the school running as normally as possible,” she said. “And that, I need hardly point out, means finding out how much you have learned this year.” Harry looked down at the pair of white rabbits he was supposed to be turning into slippers. What had he learned so far this year? He couldn’t seem to think of anything that would be useful in an exam.</p></td></tr></table></div></body></html>
