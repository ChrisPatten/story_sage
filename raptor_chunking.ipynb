      "Question: Why do you think Harry and Professor Snape dislike each other so much?\n",
      "\n",
      "Answer: Harry and Professor Snape's dislike for each other is not directly addressed in the provided context, but it can be inferred that their animosity may stem from their contrasting backgrounds and personalities. Harry has been raised by the neglectful Dursleys, while Snape likely comes from a different, perhaps more privileged or different upbringing, which influences their interactions.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Supporting Points:\n",
      "- The Dursleys, who raised Harry, are described as \"proud to say that they were perfectly normal\" and disdainful of anything unusual, which shapes Harry's early experiences and feelings of inadequacy.\n",
      "- Snape's character is hinted at through the contrast with Harry's upbringing; the Dursleys often treat Harry poorly, which could lead to a defensive and resentful attitude when interacting with authority figures like Snape.\n",
      "- The context does not provide direct interactions between Harry and Snape, but the ongoing narrative suggests a broader theme of misunderstanding and prejudice based on one’s upbringing and experiences, setting the stage for their future conflicts.\n",
      "\n",
      "Since the context provided does not mention Snape directly or any specific incident between him and Harry, any deeper analysis would venture into speculation beyond the text. Thus, the basis for their dislike largely hinges on their differing backgrounds and the implications of Harry's treatment by the Dursleys.\n",
